A simple way to send ***Personalized Emails*** to a group effortlessly

When I said goodbye to my friends and colleagues at Hungama and Awfis Space Solutions Limited, many asked me to share a script I used to invite them to the farewell part. They could see the effectiveness and knew it helped send personalized emails quickly and easily. I forgot to share it back then - I am very sorry about that! 🙏



But here it is now! 🎉



This script is:

✅ Easy to use, you should know basic Google Sheets and Docs.

✅ Great for sending personalized professional emails to large groups.

✅ A big time-saver!



It works for event invites, follow-ups, or updates. You can personalize emails without spending hours on them.



💡 All you need is Google Sheets and Docs to:

	•	Customize each email.
